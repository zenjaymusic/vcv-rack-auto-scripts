## 💾 What's Included

### 🔹 `plugin-subscribe-all.user.js`
Subscribes to all visible plugins on the page.  
You get all their current and future modules automatically via VCV’s sync.

⚠️ **Use the Free filter** to avoid subscribing to paid plugins by mistake.

### 🔹 `module-add-all.user.js`
Adds every visible module on the page, batching 10 at a time, and auto-advances through the VCV Library.

⚠️ **Apply the Free filter and start on page 1.**  
This script clicks all visible “Add” buttons — no price checking.
